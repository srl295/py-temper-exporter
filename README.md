# py-temper-exporter

Exporter for Temper probes to Prometheus using [temper.py](https://pypi.org/project/temper-py/)

## But I thought this already existed…?

Existing exporters don't seem to support my device, but `temper.py` does.

# Usage

1. install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
2. fixup your device ownership with udev or manually (TODO)
3. `poetry install`
4. `poetry run …`
